# chaosinventory
Organize an inventory in the chaos? Let's try it.

## This project is currently highly experimental, and tends to spontaneous self-ignition!

## What is planned?
- Generate labels with QR-Codes for your stuff
- Scan the codes: Displays contact information for strangers if something is lost
- Keep track of your stuff, scan it to know where it is
- Assign Items to Events/Projects
- Prepare lists "to take", scan items before and/or after the event -> know what's missing
- several storage sites: Know where a certain item is

## Concept:
- Item: Something to track, has a label
- Owner: The entity who owns the item
- Project: An Event/Project where an item is in use
- Storage Site: Something where an item is permanently stored
- Location: Location where an item is, could be a
  - Project
  - Storage Site
  - Another Item (like a box/case etc.)
